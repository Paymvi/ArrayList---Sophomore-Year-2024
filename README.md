# ArrayList---Sophomore-Year-2024
This program makes an arraylist-like array using a regular array in c++ and manually coding functions.

The program prompts the user to enter the capacity (maximum number of students) of the 
list, i.e., create a list. Then, the program provides a menu-based user interface that allows 
the user to add/delete a student, clear a list (delete all students), find a student, display a 
student, display next/previous/first/last student.
